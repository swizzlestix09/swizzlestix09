## Hi there 👋

###About me 

####Name: 
Angely Rodriguez
###Location: 
NY 🏙
###Occupation: 
Currently unemployed stay-at-home mom 👶, want to resume **Software engineering** as a **Front End Engineer** or a **Full Stack Engineer** 🖥

Hey there! I'm a full-stack software engineer who thrives on both coding and creativity. Whether I'm enhancing high-traffic pages, mentoring budding developers, or advocating for crypto policies, I'm all about making a positive impact. Coding is like a canvas for my creative mind, allowing me to constantly dismantle and rebuild with finesse. Plus, my minor obsession with styling ensures sleek, modern interfaces. When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me on my PS5 🎮, indulging in knitting or sewing projects 🪡, or having quality time with my adorable cats 🐈‍⬛ and baby boy 👦.
